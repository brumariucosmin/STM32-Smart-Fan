# STM32-Smart-Fan
#Description
This project focuses on developing an intelligent fan, controlled by a NUCLEO-H7S3L8 microcontroller. The system will use Bluetooth as the primary communication protocol, with a mobile app serving as the main control interface. If time allows, I plan to extend functionality by incorporating Wi-Fi control as well.

The fan will be powered by a DC motor, whose speed will be regulated using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Additionally, the system will feature a temperature sensor, and the fan's speed will automatically adjust based on the detected temperature levels. As the project progresses, I aim to explore the potential for additional features, such as scheduling operation intervals or integrating with other smart home devices.

I plan to work on this project regularly, with weekly updates.

#Update 1(17.OCT.2024)
I’ve finalized the project topic and ordered the microcontroller. Next, I’ll be deciding on and ordering the remaining components needed for the build.
