# STM32-Smart-Fan(RTOS)
# Description
This project aims to develop an intelligent fan, controlled by a NUCLEO-H7S3L8 microcontroller. The system will utilize Bluetooth for communication, with a mobile app serving as the primary control interface. If time permits, I plan to add Wi-Fi functionality for both control and monitoring.

The fan itself will feature a DC motor, with its speed regulated through PWM (Pulse Width Modulation). Additionally, a temperature sensor will be integrated, allowing the fan’s speed to automatically adjust based on the detected temperature. As the project progresses, and depending on available time, I will explore adding further features, such as integration with other smart devices or additional functionalities.

I plan to work consistently on this project and provide weekly updates.

# Update 1(17.OCT.2024)
I’ve finalized the project topic and ordered the microcontroller. Next, I’ll be deciding on and ordering the remaining components needed for the build.

# Update 2(26.OCT.2024)
All my remaining components have arrived, and my STM32-Nucleo microcontroller was delivered directly from Belgium , now I can start adding the code.
